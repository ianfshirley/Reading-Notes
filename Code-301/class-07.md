## REST

### How I explained REST to my brother

1. Who is Roy Fielding?
- Some smart guy. He helped write the first web servers that sent docs across the internet and then researched why the web works the way it does.
2. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
- Because they weren't designed to be used like that. The machines can only currently talk to a small number of other machines, not all.
3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
- It's about applying 'verbs' to 'nouns'. Different languages/databases etc. have different ways of talking about 'nouns'. The URL allows them to communicate with each other. The HTTP can use several 'verbs' on any 'noun' on the web. 
4. What does a GET do?
- It does what it sounds like, it retrieves data/resources.
5. What does a POST do?
- Adds something to another system
6. What does PUT do?
- replaces something in another system
7. What does PATCH do?
- does a partial update
