## React and Forms

### React Docs - Forms

1.What is a ‘Controlled Component’?  
-  they control a form's data with the component's state  

2.Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why?  
- update the state as soon as they enter info, so that info can be used right away  

3.How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?
- using event.target.name  

### The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained

1.Why would we use a ternary operator?  
- condenses conditional statements into one line of code  

2.Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:  
- x===y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false);
