## Functional Programming

### Functional Programming Concepts

1. What is functional programming?
- A style of building the structure and elements of computer programs, that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.
2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
- It returns the same result if given the same arguments.
3. What are the benefits of a pure function?
- Easier to test. No observable side effects.
4. What is immutability?
- Unchanging over time or unable to be changed.
5. What is Referential transparency?
- pure functions + immutable data
