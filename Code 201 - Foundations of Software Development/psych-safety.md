### What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

#### Why This Topic Matters

This topic is relevant to anyone, anywhere, anytime. It's relevant in school, at work, in sports, hobbies and in your personal life. It's especially relevant to those of us who are transitioning careers and will be stepping into a new area where many people struggle with imposter syndrome. It was pretty dense reading, but I was really enjoying it by the end.  
The (very) short version of the article is this:   
Google spent several years and a lot of money to find out what makes a team successful. For a long time they found nothing but seemingly contradicting data patterns. In the end they found that a team's success boiled down to two things: conversational turn-taking and average social sensitivity.   
Conversation turn-taking means that in a meeting or other group setting, all participants spent roughly equal amounts of time speaking. On the other end of the spectrum, there are teams where one person takes over and speaks the whole time and one or several other team members barely speak, if at all. The teams that participate equally in their dialogue are the most successful.  
Average social sensitivity basically means the level of empathy that all the team members have for each other, or how sensitive they are to their teammate's social cues, facial expressions, body language etc. The teams that were not as capable of intuitively picking up on nonverbal cues did not perform as well.  
These two factors contribute to "a shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking" ([Edmondson, 1999](https://web.mit.edu/curhan/www/docs/Articles/15341_Readings/Group_Performance/Edmondson%20Psychological%20safety.pdf)), or **psychological safety**. In other words, for a team to be successful, team members need to feel comfortable being themselves within the team dynamic, and feel confident that speaking up will not result in embarrassment or rejection from their team members.  

A very **very** short summary of what makes a team function well together: BE NICE. : )
