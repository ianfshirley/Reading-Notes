## Pain vs. Suffering / Big O Notation

### Pain vs. Suffering

- This article and the one that it links to discuss the difference between pain and suffering. They remind us that we will experience pain in our lives, and especially over the next 10 weeks during Python 401. We will experience the pain of growth, of exhaustion and confusion, but we need to keep in mind what this pain means (that we are growing and learning), and what we will earn with this pain (a better and happier career & life). Accept the pain, and move on. Use all your available resources (peers, teachers, friends, google, youtube etc.) to move past the pain and avoid the optional suffering.

### Big O Notation

- Big O Notation is used to describe the execution time required or the space used by an algorithm.
- O(1) - describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set
- O(N) - describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set
- O(NÂ²) - represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set. Common with algorithms that involve nested iterations over the data set.
- O(2^N) - denotes and algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set. The growth curve is exponential, starting shallow and rising exponentially.
- Logarithms / O(log N) - It will select the middle element in a data set, and compare it against a target value. If values match, it returns success, if target is higher than the value of the probe element, it will take the upper half of the data set and perform the same operation against it. If lower, it will perform against the lower half. It will continue to halve the data set until it can't be halved anymore. This will produce a growth curve that goes up sharply at first and then levels off, as each successive iteration will take less time/space than the previous iteration. (I'm scared... it's been 13 years since I took a math class)
