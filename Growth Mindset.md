# Growth Mindset

## Upgrade your technical skills with deliberate practice

- This article is explaining that just doing your programming job every day is not necessarily going to make you a better programmer. You need to actively push yourself, try new things, challenge yourself and get out of your comfort zone. This is how you will truly become a better programmer. It made me think of snowboarding. if I go snowboarding many times during a season, I will likely be more skilled at the end of the season. However, if I train at home in between trips to the mountain, and specifically target muscles and movements that will help me be a stronger snowboarder, my skill on the mountain will improve much more than it would from just going snowboarding more often.

## Carol Dweck - The power of believing that you can improve

- This video focuses on the growth mindset in general. When you encounter a problem you can't solve, do you think you're not smart enough to solve it, or do you think you just need to find more information or develop new skills before you can solve it?
- How to develop this growth mindset: reward the effort & the process, not the skill or intelligence.
- If you can't do something, just add "yet" to the end of the sentence: "I can't do this" vs. "I can't do this **yet**"

## Angela Lee Duckworth - Grit: The power of passion and perseverance

- This video is somewhat similar to the previous one. It highlights the importance effort and the process (grit/perserverance/passion) over intelligence.
- This one is interesting to me, because as someone with ADHD & Autism, I've always pushed myself, to prove to myself and everyone else that I can do just as well, and even better than neurotypical people. Also, both ADHD & Autism can lead to hyperfixation on a topic or a skill, and once I decide I want to learn a skill, I will stubbornly persist until I have developed the skill to my satisfaction (which is usually a higher level than what is really needed).

## Alain de Botton - A kinder, gentler philosophy of success

- "Job Snobbery"
- This video discusses the broken system of judging a person's level of success by their job.
- The illusion of equality is a problem as well. We have this idea in modern society that we are in a meritocracy and that anything is possible based on your choices and actions. This is simply not true.

## Emotional Intelligence Self-Assessment Tool

- Self-Awareness: 21/25
- Self-Management: 19/25
- Social Awareness: 23/25
- Relationship Management: 19/25

- My scores did not surprise me, and I got almost exactly the same scores as when I took the assessment in 201. I am very self-aware, and aware of other people's actions and often their emotions. I'm a very empathetic person (sometimes too much). I could stand to work on managing my moods and relationship management. I think I have a very high emotional intelligence, but I would assume that most people think they are emotionally intelligent, whether they are or not. I've been meditating, and it's helped me notice some areas where I was not as good as I thought, and I'm working on those areas.

## Bias Self-Assessment

- As someone with ADHD and Autism, I am constantly -nearly every minute of every day- evaluating myself, what I'm doing, why, and how it's effecting the people around me. I was not surprised at all to find that the areas where I scored the lowest were 'Meaningful Connections' and 'Four Ways to Act'. It can be very difficult for me to reach out to new people and expand my network, because it takes extra effort for me to conform to social norms, which can also make it more difficult to connect with people.

Two things that I'd really like to work on are putting self-care first over work, and getting more involved in allyship & advocacy. Self-care is something that should almost always take priority, but I frequently let my goals take precedence. Recently I've not had the time or mental bandwidth to get more involved in allyship and dealing with societal issues, but I'm hoping that will change in the near future.
