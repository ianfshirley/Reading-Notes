## Introduction to React and Components

### Component-Based Architecture

1.What is a “component”?  
- It's a piece of code that has a clearly defined interface and conforms to recommended behavior of all components within an architecture. It is intended to interact with other components.  

2.What are the characteristics of a component?  
- Reusability − Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications. However, some components may be designed for a specific task.

- Replaceable − Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.

- Not context specific − Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.

- Extensible − A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

- Encapsulated − A A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.

- Independent − Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.
