## Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

### That Time When Women Stopped Coding

1. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?
- Personal computers started showing up in people's homes, and they were mostly marketed to men & boys as toys or tools for word processing.
2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
- It gave men an unfair advantage when men and women were both starting computer classes in college, and mostly women were starting fresh while men had prior personal experience.


### Why diversity matters to your tech company

1. When are diversity efforts most successful?
- When company leaders understand why it matters and they are committed to the efforts
2. Why do diverse companies perform better?
- Because having more diverse employees helps to improve creativity and effectiveness in problem-solving. More diverse teams have different ways of looking at problems and come up with solutions faster. Avoiding discrimination based on race, gender or whatever else will also will also make sure companies are not missing out on the best talent.
3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
- YouTube's iOS app was designed by a team of right-handed people, which created issues for left-handed users. This same sort of problem can happen if something is made only by white people, or only by men; it can be very exclusionary. It's extremely important for tech companies to cultivate diversity so that their products can take into account experiences of people from different backgrounds, so that their products can properly engage a wider audience.
