### 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?
  1. Greater efficiency - easier to catch mistakes as they're happening, requiring less debugging later. Come up with solutions faster with 2 peopls discussing ideas. When stuck, each person can search for fixes.
  2. Engaged collaboration - with 2 people both programmers are more focused. Harder to procrastinate or get off track. Also helps get more comfortable asking for help.
  3. Learning from fellow students/teammates - Each of us have different strengths and know little tricks that others might not. Pair programming allows us all to learn from each other's strengths and shortcuts.
  4. Social skills - helps build communication and teamwork skills
  5. Job Intervew Readiness - It's common in interview for an applicant to work through a problem while paired with an existing employee. It shows not only what you currently know, but how you go about solving problems and finding answers and asking for help.
  6. Work environment readiness - many companies use pair programming to train new hires, and some continue to work this way. My wife's company is like this, she is working with another team member more often than she works alone.
2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
- Catching mistakes faster, learning from each other, and the increased efficiency that comes from one person making up for the other person's weak points.
3. How does pair programming work?
- Typically involves the role of the driver & navigator.
- Driver: the only one with hands on the keyboard, physically taking actions.
- Navigator: guides the driver but does not directly interact with the computer. They can also look up solutions or look forward to the next steps as the driver is working.
