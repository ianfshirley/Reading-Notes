## Data Visualization

### Matplotlib Tutorial

- **matplotlib** is probably the most used Python package for 2D graphics. It provides both a very quick way to visualize data from Python and publication-quality figures in many formats.

- **IPython** is an enhanced interactive Python shell that has lots of intersting features including named inputs/outputs, access to shell commands, improved debugging etc. It allows interactive matplotlib sessions that have Matlab/Mathematica-like functions

- **pyplot** provides a convenient interface to the matplotlib object-oriented plotting library. It is modeled closely after Matlab. Therefore, the majority of plotting commands have Matlab analogs with similar arguments.
