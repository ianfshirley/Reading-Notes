## Reading Serverless Functions

### What is Serverless Computing?

- Serverless is a cloud computing application development and execution model that enables devs to build and run application code without provisioning or managing servers or backend infrastructure.
- It allows devs to put all their focus into writing the best front-end application code and business logic they can. 
- They deploy their code to containers managed by a cloud service provider.
- The cloud provider handles the rest, provisioning cloud infrastructure required to run the code, and scaling the infrastructure up and down as needed.
- While there are servers, they are invisible to the developers, and they don't need to manage or interact with them in any way.
- Examples of serverless cloud service providers:
  - AWS Lambda, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, IBM Cloud
- Serverless computing, microservices and containers form a triumvirate of technologies that are typically considered to be at the core of cloud-native application development.
- FaaS (function-as-a-service) is the compute model central to serverless, and the two terms are often used interchangably.

- Use cases for serverless:
  - Supporting microservices architectures
  - API backends
  - Data processing
  - Massively parallel compute/"Map" operations
  - Stream processing workloads
