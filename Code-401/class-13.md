## Linear Regressions

### How to Run Linear Regression in Python with Scikit-Learn

- Scikit-learn is a Python package that simplifies the implementation of a wide range of Machine Learning (ML) methods for predictive data analysis, including linear regression.
- Linear regression can be thought of as finding the straight line that best fits a set of scattered data points

- Key concepts working with scikit-learn's linear regression method:
  - best fit - straight line in a plot that minimizes deviation between related scattered data points
  - coefficient - AKA parameter, is the factor a variable is multiplied by
  - coefficient of determination - correlation coefficient denoted as $R^2$. Used to describe the precision or degree of fit in a regression
  - correlation - relationship between two variables in terms of quantifiable strength and degree. values range between -1.0 and 1.0
  - dependent feature - AKA response/output - a variable denoted as the y in the slope equation y=ax+b
  - residual - vertical distance between a data point and the line of regression
  - regression model - the idea formula for approximating a regression
  - slope - steepness of a line of regression

- Regression vs. Classification
  - The main difference between regression and classification is that the output variable in regression is continuous, while the output for classification is discrete. Regression predicts quantity, classification predicts labels.
