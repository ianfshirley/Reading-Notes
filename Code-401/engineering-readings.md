## Engineering Readings

### Act like you make $1000/hr

- I agree with the main message of this article: value your time. However, most of it is talking about how you shouldn't be busy, that it's a distraction from doing what really matters. This is a very privileged take. Most normal people are busy just making sure they and their loved ones are fed, healthy and housed. Most normal people don't have time to focus on their goals.
- One very valuable point from this article to keep in mind:
  - Take stock of what you spend time on each day/week/month. How many of those tasks were truly necessary / how many actually improved your life or moved you closer to your goals vs. how many of those tasks were basically a waste of time?

### How to think like a programmer — lessons in problem solving

- How most people solve problems:
  1. try a solution
  2. if that doesn't work, try another solution
  3. if that doesn't work, repeat step 2 until something works
- A better way:
  1. Have a framework
  2. practice it
- Build your framework/problem-solving strategy
  1. Understand - know exactly what is being asked. You should be able to explain it in plain English.
  2. Plan - write down the exact steps
  3. Divide - the most important step of all - break your problem up into smaller sub-problems, and solve those one by one. Once you've solved all the sub-problems, connect the dots
  4. Stuck?
    - Debug: go step by step through your solution and try to find where you went wrong
    - Reassess: take a step back, look at the problem from another perspective. You might even want to start over from scratch!
    - Research: google it
- Practice
  - Chess, puzzles, math problems, crosswords, video games etc.
  - Find an outlet to practice, something that allows you to solve many micro-problems, ideally something that you enjoy

### How to Solve Programming Problems

1. Read the problem completely, twice
2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data
3. Optimize the manual steps
4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code
5. Replace the comments or pseudo-doce with real code
6. Optimize the real code

### The 5 Whys

- Developed by Sakichi Toyoda in the 1930s
- Can be used for troubleshooting, quality improvement & problem solving, but it is most effective when used to resolve simple or moderately difficult problems.
- Seven Step Process:
  1. Assemble a team of people familiar with the specifics of the problem
  2. Define the problem - discuss with your team and write a brief, clear problem statement. Example: "Team A isn't meeting its response time targets"
  3. Ask the first "Why?" - "Why isn't Team A meeting its response time targets?"
  4. Ask "Why?" in response to the answer from step 3's question
  5. Ask "Why?" in response to the answer from step 4's question
  6. Ask "Why?" in response to the answer from step 5's question
  7. Ask "Why?" in response to the answer from step 6's question
- Come up with a counter-measure for the response to step 7's question

### The Super Mario Effect

- Focus and not the princess and not the pits to stick with a task and learn more
- Learn from your failures, but don't focus on them. Instead, keep them in mind while focusing on how best to achieve your goal

### Discussion Questions

1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?
- Relentless curiosity and an innate need for understanding. I will frequently go above and beyond my job requirements because I NEED to know how something happens. Once I find the answer to that "how", I typically go on to determine why something is happening the way it is. I need for things to make sense to me, so if I find that the answer to either "how" or "why" is not the most logical and effective solution, I usually try to find out what *is* the most effective response to "how" and "why".
2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?
- Take a step back, look at the problem from a different angle. If necessary, start over completely.
- Divide the problem into smaller sub-problems
- Google it
