- Web scraping is a technique to automatically access and extract large amounts of information from a website, which can save a huge amount of time and effort.
- Important notes about web scraping:
  - Read through the website's Terms and Conditions to understand how you can legally use the data. Most sites prohibit you from using the data for commercial purposes.
  - Make sure you are not downloading data at too rapid a rate because this may break the website. You may potentially be blocked from the site as well.
- The first step is to figure out where to find the links to the files we want to download, within multiple levels of HTML tags
