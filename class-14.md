### CSS Transforms

1.What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?  
* It allows new ways of positioning and altering HTML elements. It can be used to change the size (x+y axis or just one axis), change layers with the z-axis, rotate and skew elements, and more.  

2.Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.  
* I can think of many ways this would be helpful when creating/designing a website. One example would be the rotate function; this could be used to rotate a text element, either just for style or as a label for some kind of graphic where having horizontal or vertical text would not be as clear as if it were diagonal.   
Another example I'm looking forward to trying out is 'translate'. I'm hoping that it will solve the problem of when your CSS positioning gets your element in the right area, but you just want to move it a little bit to get it perfect.


### CSS Transitions & Animations

1.What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?  
* It allows the altering the appearance or behavior of an element when a change of state occurs.  

2.How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?  
* Transitions only work for single state changes. Animations allow more control by using the @keyframes rule. They allow multiple different animations/actions at different points. You can also make the animation run several times (or infinitely) instead of just once.


### 8 Simple CSS3 Transitions That Will Wow Your Users

1.What are some benefits to using CSS transitions on websites?  
* First, and most obvious is that it can make a website much more visually appealing. It can also make the page look more professional and modern, and not like it's from 1993. Using transitions on an element can also help increase user engagement, and to draw the user's eye to a certain part of the page, either to make sure they see important information or to direct them to a part of the page that requires interaction.  

2.How does this topic fit in with your long-term goals?  
* This fits in very well with my long-term goals (although it's highly likely that those will change as I learn more). At this point, I really enjoy designing how a website will look, and the transform and transition effects seem like they will be really helpful to get the website's appearance really dialed in.
