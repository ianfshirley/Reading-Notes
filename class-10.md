## Readings: Debugging

### What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript

1.Name a key difference between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.  
* Syntax Errors - These will usually give you an error message, letting you know there are spelling errors in your code that are not letting it run properly.  
* Logic Errors - Syntax is correct, so you won't get an error message. Harder to fix. I've had lots of these in the salmon cookies project! For me it's usually putting something in the wrong place or just missing an entire line of code.  

2.List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.  
* As mentioned above, syntax errors will usually give you a message and then you can figure out what you need to change.
* When it's a logic error and I don't know what's causing it, there are two main ways that I've fixed them: messing around and trying different things- changing placement or adding/removing lines by commenting them out or un-commenting, or by asking a TA, a classmate or my wife.  

3.How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?  
* I'm going to have to get good at finding the errors in my code if I ever want to be productive as a developer. It can take so long sometimes and really extend the time a project takes.

### The JavaScript Debugger

1.How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?  
* It's a developer tool inside the browser that can help you identify problems preventing your code from working.  

2.Define what a breakpoint is.  
* A point in your program where the code will "break", or stop executing. You can do this using the JS debugger. It can help you identify which parts of your code are working or not.  

3.What is the call stack?  
* It shows you what code has run to get you to your current line.
