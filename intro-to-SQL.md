# Introduction to SQL

## SQL = Structured Query Language

It's a search language for you to instruct a database about what information you'd like retrieved from it.

SQL Databases are structured as tables. Each table has rows & columns. The rows are items/documents in the database, the columns are basically the schema for the documents in the database. Each row/item must have information for each column in the table. This differs from noSQL databases, where each document in a database doesn't necessarily need to match the same schema (structured vs. unstructured).

There are many different ways to alter your search query and the way it displays the results.

You can SELECT specific columns from a table. You can select only the rows WHERE a specific condition is met. You can ORDER BY certain criteria. You can JOIN tables together so that you can return data from multiple tables in one line. You can LIMIT the number of results or OFFSET the results to start at a certain point in the list or results.

You can INSERT rows into a table, adding documents that match the schema of the existing table. You can UPDATE rows by changing data for a specific column in that row (or multiple columns). You can DELETE rows. You can CREATE new tables. You can ALTER tables by adding or dropping columns, or by renaming the table. You can DELETE tables.
