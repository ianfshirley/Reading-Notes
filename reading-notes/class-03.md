## Learn CSS  
### The Box Model  

1.Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?  
&ensp;&ensp;Imagine a person skateboading. If the edge of the page is a wall/floor, and the content is a person, the margin would be cushioning attached to the wall/floor, and the padding would be cushion attached to the person.   

2.List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model.  
&ensp;&ensp;Content: text, images etc. Padding: white space around content. Border: wraps around the padding, which is around the content. Margin: space between content/padding/border and the outsides of the page.  

## Learn JS  
### Arrays. Operators and Expression. Conditionals, Loops.  

1.What data types can you store inside of an Array?  
&ensp;&ensp;Strings, numbers, objects, other arrays  

2.Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?  
&ensp;&ensp;

 const people = [['pete', 32, 'librarian', null], ['Smith', 40, 'accountant', 'fishing:hiking:rock_climbing'], ['bill', null, 'artist', null]];  

3.List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.  
&ensp;&ensp;-x += 1 is the same as x = x + 1  
&ensp;&ensp;-x -= 1 is the same as x = x - 1  
&ensp;&ensp;-x *= 1 is the same as x = x * 1   
&ensp;&ensp;-x /= 1 is the same as x = x / 1   
&ensp;&ensp;-x %= f() is the same as x = x % f()  


4.Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.  
&ensp;&ensp;

 let a = 10;
 let b = 'dog';
 let c = false;

 // evaluate this
 (a + c) + b;  

5.Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program.  
&ensp;&ensp;Bribing someone. "if you do this, you will get this"  

6.Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript.  
&ensp;&ensp;When you want to repeat a task many times
