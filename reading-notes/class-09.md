## HTML Forms

1.Why are forms so important in web development?  
&ensp;&ensp; Because they are one of the main ways that users interact with websites, and they can allow users to immediately update the UI.  

2.When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience?  
&ensp;&ensp;Keep it simple/make it easy for the user, only ask for the data you need.  

3.List 5 form elements and explain their importance.
&ensp;&ensp;* <form>  Container element that defines a form
&ensp;&ensp;* <label>Caption or definition of a user input field     
&ensp;&ensp;* <input>Single line text field. You can also set the 'type' of input to be just text, or to only accept an email address  
&ensp;&ensp;* <textarea>Multi-line text field. Another difference between input & textarea is that input is a void element (it does not require a closing tag).  
&ensp;&ensp;* <button>The button allows the user to send, or submit the form. There are three types: submit - (submits the form/sends the data); reset - (resets the form to start over); and button - (this does not do anything in html but its function can be defined using JS)  

## Learn JS

1.How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?  

&ensp;&ensp;Events are actions taking place in the system you're programming. When the event happens or "fires", it sends a signal to your code/program. You can also create an 'event handler' that will run when the event fires. Event handlers are also called event listeners. A user clicking a button is an example of an event. 

2.When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?  

&ensp;&ensp;The name of the event, and the function to handle the event.
3.Describe the event object. Why is the target within the object useful?  
&ensp;&ensp;It allows you to specify that the action taken when the event fires happens in the element the user interacted with.
4.What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?  
&ensp;&ensp;
