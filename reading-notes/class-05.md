2.Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?    
&ensp;&ensp;I'd change the background color, maybe add a background image. I would also add some color to the text, maybe some borders and boxes with colors different than the background.  

3.What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?    
&ensp;&ensp;whether or not it is a websafe/widely accepted font.
