### Creating Hyperlinks

1.To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?  
&ensp;&ensp; 'a'   

2.The href attribute contains what information?  
&ensp;&ensp; the url (hypertext reference)  

3.What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?  
&ensp;&ensp;add text rather than just adding a title in the 'a' element  


## CSS Layout

1.What is meant by “normal flow”?  
&ensp;&ensp;The layout before you make any changes  

2.What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?  
&ensp;&ensp; blocks are vertical (but they can be changed), inline elements are horizontal. blocks fill the space of their parent element, inline elements are just the size of their content. inline elements ignore margins  

3.___ positioning is the default for every html element.  
&ensp;&ensp;static  

4.Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.  
&ensp;&ensp;It's separate from the normal document flow, so it doesn't effect other elements. you can position them without other elements changing their position  

5.What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?  
&ensp;&ensp;fixed is relative to the viewport. absolute is relative to the ancestor element, if there is one

### Functions - Reusable Blocks of Code

1.Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.  
&ensp;&ensp;declaring a function is saying what a function should do, invoking the function makes it take the action you declared  

2.What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?  
&ensp;&ensp;

## Miscellaneous

1.Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.  
&ensp;&ensp;Greater efficiency - talking it out might lead you to solutions faster than thinking about it on your own. Also, with two sets of eyes the code is less likely to have errors that will require going over the code again later.  
Job interview/work envinronment readiness - this type of work, as well as being able to explain your process and reasoning, will help you in interviews and when starting a new job
