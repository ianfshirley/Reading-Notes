## Learn CSS - Flexbox

1.Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.  

&ensp;&ensp;It will only display items in one direction, horizontal or vertical.  

2.Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.  
&ensp;&ensp;The main axis is the one you set with flex-direction. Cross axis is obviously perpendicular to that. If you set the flex-direction as a row, then the column would be the cross axis.  

3.How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?  
&ensp;&ensp;Reversing the flow of items in a flexbox changes the direction they display, so that it's the opposite of the normal flow of HTML. Navigating using a keyboard will still go in the normal direction of the HTML document, but a screen reader will read items in the opposite direction, which could be confusing.   


## CSS Layout - Flexbox

1.What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?  
&ensp;&ensp;It's easier to center a block of content inside its parent. Making columns adopt the same height even if the amount of content is different. Making all the children of a container take up the same amount of space regardless of the space available. 

2.How does this topic connect with your long term goals?  
&ensp;&ensp;It connects pretty well. I actually enjoy working with CSS and designing the page layout.
